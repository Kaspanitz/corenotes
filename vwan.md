# Virtual WAN
Last update: 9 July 2024
- [Mainstream Microsoft Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-service-by-category#available-services-by-region-category)
  - Available in all recommended regions within 90 days of the region general availability. Demand-driven in alternate regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of alternate regions.
- Central operational interface for networking, routing and security
- Hub-Spoke architecture
- Scale
- Performance
- [Global transit network architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture)
  - 'Hub' enables transitive connectivity between endpoints that might be distributed across different types of 'spokes' e.g.
    - Virtual network (VNets)
    - Physical branch site
    - Remote user
    - Internet
  - [Any-to-any](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture#anytoany)
    - Less complex to manage than full mesh networks
    - Examples via transit hub(s):
      - Branch-to-VNet (a)
        - Explicit gateway transit not required - vWAN enables automatic gateway transit

      - ExpressRoute Global Reach and Virtual WAN
        - Private communication between on-premises networks across different locations using ExpressRoute circuits and Microsoftâ€™s global network
        - ExpressRoute Skus supported by vWAN: Local, Standard, and Premium
        - Can enable ExpressRoute to ExpressRoute transit connectivity by enabling ExpressRoute **Global Reach** on your ExpressRoute circuits
          -  Global Reach is an ExpressRoute add-on feature that allows you to link ExpressRoute circuits in different peering locations together to make a private network.
          -  Note 1: ExpressRoute-to-ExpressRoute transit connectivity between circuits with the Global Reach add-on **will not transit the vWAN hub** because Global Reach enables a more optimal path over the global backbone
          -  Note 2: The Routing Intent feature can be used with private traffic routing policies to enable ExpressRoute transit connectivity via a security appliance deployed in the vWAN Hub. **This option doesn't require Global Reach**

## Features
- Branch connectivity:
  - Virtual WAN Partner devices (e.g. SD-WAN or VPN CPE)
  - Site-to-site VPN connectivity (S2S)
  - Private connectivity (ExpressRoute)
  - VPN ExpressRoute inter-connectivity
- User connectivity:
  - Remote user VPN connectivity (P2S)
- Intra-cloud connectivity:
  - transitive connectivity for Vnets
  - cross-region VNet connection
    - Single Hub:
      - vWAN hub in region with most spokes (branches, VNets, users)
      - Connect spokes in other regions to the hub e.g. VNet in one region can be connected to a vWAN hub in a different region
      - Good option when an enterprise footprint is mostly in one region with a few remote spokes
        ![1hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/media/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture/transit-network.png "1vwan")
    - Hub-to-hub:
      - When optimal (latency-wise) to access the cloud from a region closest to physical site and users
      - When multiple hubs are enabled in a single vWAN, the hubs are automatically interconnected via hub-to-hub links, thus enabling global connectivity between branches and Vnets that are distributed across multiple regions.
      - Hubs in same vWAN, can be associated with different regional access and security policies
        ![multiplehubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/media/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture/cross-region.png "2vwan")
- Routing, Azure Firewall, and encryption for private connectivity
