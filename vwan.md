# Virtual WAN
Last update: 9 July 2024
- [Mainstream Microsoft Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-service-by-category#available-services-by-region-category)
  - Available in all recommended regions within 90 days of the region general availability. Demand-driven in alternate regions, and many are already deployed into a large subset of alternate regions.
- Central operational interface for networking, routing and security
- Hub-Spoke architecture
- Scale
- Performance
- [Global transit network architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture)
  - 'Hub' enables transitive connectivity between endpoints that might be distributed across different types of 'spokes' e.g.
    - Virtual network (VNets)
    - Physical branch site
    - Remote user
    - Internet
  - [Any-to-any](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture#anytoany)
    - Less complex to manage than full mesh networks
    - Examples via transit hub(s):

      - ExpressRoute and vWAN
        - Private communication between on-premises networks across different locations using ExpressRoute circuits and Microsoftâ€™s global network
        - ExpressRoute Skus supported by vWAN: Local, Standard, and Premium
        - Customers must choose between [two configuration options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies#expressroute):
          - **Option 1: ExpressRoute Global Reach**
            -   ExpressRoute-to-ExpressRoute transit connectivity with ExpressRoute **Global Reach** added to ExpressRoute circuits
            -   Global Reach is an ExpressRoute add-on feature that allows you to link ExpressRoute circuits in different peering locations together to make a private network.
            - ExpressRoute-to-ExpressRoute transit connectivity between circuits with Global Reach **will not transit via the vWAN hub** because Global Reach enables a more optimal path over the global backbone
          - **Option 2: Routing Intent private policy**
            - The [Routing Intent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/how-to-routing-policies#expressroute) feature can be used with private traffic routing policies to enable ExpressRoute transit connectivity via a security appliance deployed in the vWAN Hub.
            - **This option doesn't require Global Reach**
            - **Note:** To enable ExpressRoute-to-ExpressRoute transit connectivity via a Firewall appliance in the hub with private routing policies, open a support case with Microsoft Support. This option is not compatible with Global Reach and requires Global Reach to be disabled to ensure proper transit routing between all ExpressRoute circuits connected to Virtual WAN.
          - Connectivity across ExpressRoute circuits via a Firewall appliance in the hub with routing intent private routing policy is available in the following configurations:
            - Both ExpressRoute circuits are connected to the same hub and a private routing policy is configured on that hub.
            - ExpressRoute circuits are connected to different hubs and a private routing policy is configured on both hubs. Therefore, both hubs must have a security solution deployed.

## Features
- Branch connectivity:
  - Virtual WAN Partner devices (e.g. SD-WAN or VPN CPE)
  - Site-to-site VPN connectivity (S2S)
  - Private connectivity (ExpressRoute)
  - VPN ExpressRoute inter-connectivity
- User connectivity:
  - Remote user VPN connectivity (P2S)
- Intra-cloud connectivity:
  - transitive connectivity for Vnets
  - cross-region VNet connection
    - Single Hub:
      - vWAN hub in region with most spokes (branches, VNets, users)
      - Connect spokes in other regions to the hub e.g. VNet in one region can be connected to a vWAN hub in a different region
      - Good option when an enterprise footprint is mostly in one region with a few remote spokes
        ![1hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/media/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture/transit-network.png "1vwan")
    - Hub-to-hub:
      - When optimal (latency-wise) to access the cloud from a region closest to physical site and users
      - When multiple hubs are enabled in a single vWAN, the hubs are automatically interconnected via hub-to-hub links, thus enabling global connectivity between branches and Vnets that are distributed across multiple regions.
      - Hubs in same vWAN, can be associated with different regional access and security policies
        ![multiplehubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/media/virtual-wan-global-transit-network-architecture/cross-region.png "2vwan")
- Routing, Azure Firewall, and encryption for private connectivity
  - Routing intent and routing policies:
    - Simple, declarative routing policies to send Internet-bound and Private traffic to security solutions (e.g. Azure Firewall, NVA or Saa) solutions in vWAN hub
    - It is **not possible** configure Routing Policies if hub isn't deployed with Azure Firewall, NVA or SaaS solution
    - Routing Intent simplifies routing by managing route table associations and propagations for all connections (Vnet, S2S VPN, P2S VPN and ExpressRoute). VWANs with custom route tables and customized policies therefore can't be used with the Routing Intent constructs.
    - Two types:
      Note: Max 1 of each/vWAN Hub. A single next hop.
      1. Internet Traffic Routing Policy: vWAN advertises a default (0.0.0.0/0) route to all spokes, Gateways and Network Virtual Appliances (deployed in the hub or spoke)
      2. Private Traffic Routing Policy: Both branch and Vnet address prefixes
